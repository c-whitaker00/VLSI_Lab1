# VLSI_Lab1
All written in Verilog, this lab covers an unsigned parallel multiplier (Problem 1), multiplication of signed operands (Problem 2), a conditional sum adder (Problem 3), and a k-1 N bit adder (Problem 4), and a sequential logic circuit (Problem 5).

The assignment file is in this repo, so feel free to take a look to see what the actual projects were.
